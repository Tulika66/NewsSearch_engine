      "\n",
      "Cameroon says widespread corruption in its finance ministry has cost it 1bn CFA francs ($2m; Â£1m) a month.\n",
      "\n",
      "About 500 officials are accused of either awarding themselves extra money or claiming salaries for \"non-existent\" workers. Prime Minister Ephraim Inoni, who vowed to tackle corruption when he came to office last year, said those found guilty would face tough punishments. The scam is believed to have begun in 1994.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prime minister's office said the alleged fraud was uncovered during an investigation into the payroll at the ministry. In certain cases, staff are said to have lied about their rank and delayed their retirement in order to boost their earnings. The prime minister's office said auditors had found \"irregularities in the career structure of certain civil servants\". It added that the staff in question \"appear to have received unearned salaries, boosting the payroll\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Fidelis Nanga, a journalist based in the Cameroon capital Yaounde, said the government was considering taking criminal action against those found guilty and forcing them to repay any money owed. \"The prime minister has given instructions for exemplary penalties to be meted out against the accused and their accomplices if found guilty,\" he told the BBC's Network Africa programme.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Inoni launched an anti-corruption drive in December after foreign investors criticised a lack of transparency in the country's public finances. In one initiative designed to improve efficiency, civil servants who arrived late for work were locked out of their offices. The government now intends to carry out an audit of payrolls at all other government ministries. In a report compiled by anti-corruption body Transparency International in 2003, graft was said to be \"pervasive\" in Cameroon.\n",

      "\n",
      "Chancellor Gordon Brown has been given a Â£2.1bn boost in his attempts to meet his golden economic rule, which allows him to borrow only for investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The extra leeway came after the Office for National Statistics said it had been measuring road expenditure data wrongly over the past five years. It comes just weeks ahead of the Budget and an expected general election. Shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: \"At best the timing of these changes is very convenient for the government.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A review by the ONS found it had made a mistake by \"double counting\" some spending on roads since 1998/9. Correcting the error would mean reducing current expenditure and increasing net investment, thus helping Mr Brown to meet his \"golden rule\" of borrowing only to invest over the economic cycle. Economists speculated that it might also allow for some vote-catching measures in the Budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "The changes by the ONS increase the current budget measure for the past five years by Â£2.1bn in total. Mr Letwin said: \"This is a very murky area... There will inevitably be suspicions that the figures are being fiddled.\" The Conservatives also said Mr Brown would still be forced to raise taxes after the general election to fill an annual Â£10.5bn \"black hole\" in the nation's coffers. But the Treasury said there would be no relaxation of economic discipline and the golden rule would be met even without the data revisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In January the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said Mr Brown would need to raise taxes to get public finances onto the track predicted in last year's Budget. It also said the government might narrowly miss its \"golden rule\" if the current economic cycle ended in 2005/06. After the ONS announcement, economists said there could also be a proportionate boost to the current budget in 2004/05 of about Â£400m. \"None of this changes the big picture of a dramatic deterioration in the overall fiscal position over the last four or five years,\" said Jonathan Loynes, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. \"Accordingly, it seems very likely that some form of fiscal consolidation will be required in due course.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "The government of Nigeria is hoping to triple cocoa production over the next three years with the launch of an ambitious development programme.\n",
      "\n",
      "Agriculture Minister Adamu Bello said the scheme aimed to boost production from an expected 180,000 tonnes this year to 600,000 tonnes by 2008. The government will pump 154m naira ($1.1m; Â£591,000) into subsidies for farming chemicals and seedlings. Nigeria is currently the world's fourth-largest cocoa producer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cocoa was the main export product in Nigeria during the 1960s. But with the coming of oil, the government began to pay less attention to the cocoa sector and production began to fall from a peak of about 400,000 tonnes a year in 1970. At the launch of the programme in the south-western city of Ibadan, Mr Bello explained that an additional aim of the project is to encourage the processing of cocoa in the country and lift local consumption. He also announced that 91m naira of the funding available had been earmarked for establishing cocoa plant nurseries. The country could be looking to emulate rival Ghana, which produced a bumper crop last year. However, some farmers are sceptical about the proposals. \"People who are not farming will hijack the subsidy,\" said Joshua Osagie, a cocoa farmer from Edo state told Reuters. \"The farmers in the village never see any assistance,\" he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time as Nigeria announced its new initiative, Ghana - the world's second largest cocoa exporter - announced revenues from the industry had broken new records. The country saw more than $1.2bn-worth of the beans exported during 2003-04. Analysts said high tech-production techniques and crop spraying introduced by the government led to the huge crop, pushing production closer to levels seen in the 1960s when the country was the world's leading cocoa grower.\n",

The measure is designed to legitimise previously hidden economic activity and boost Georgia's flagging economy. Georgia's black market is estimated to be twice the size of its legal economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Saakashvili, elected president in January after Mr Shevardnadze was toppled, has urged the Georgian Parliament to approve the amnesty as soon as possible. It is one of a series of proposals designed to tackle corruption, which was rampant during the Shevardnadze era, and boost Georgia's fragile public finances.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new government is encouraging companies to pay taxes by scrapping existing corruption investigations and destroying all tax records from before 1 January, three days before President Saakashvili was elected. \"There are people who have money but are afraid to show it,\" the president told a government session. \"Documentation about where this money came from doesn't exist because under the former, entirely warped regime, earning capital honestly was not possible.\"\n",

      "\"No one will have the right to check this money's origin. This money must go back into the economy.\" The amnesty will not extend to people who made money through drugs trafficking or international money laundering. Criminal investigations in such cases -thought to involve about 5% of Georgian businesses -are to continue. Mr Saakashvili has accused the Shevardnadze regime, which was toppled by a popular uprising in November, of allowing bribery to flourish. Georgia's economy is in a desperate condition. Half the population are living below the poverty line with many surviving on income of less than $4, or three euros, a day. The unemployment rate is around 20% while the country has a $1.7bn public debt.\n",
